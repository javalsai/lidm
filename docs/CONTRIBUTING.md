  - [Code](#code)
  - [Issues](#issues)
  - [Other](#other)

## Code

For small fixes or incremental improvements simply fork the repo and follow the process below.

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository and [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork.

2. Start coding! (it might be helpful to read a [quide on the project structure and conventions](./structure.md) before this)
   - Configure clangd LSP by generating `compile_commands.json` (e.g. `bear -- make` or `compiledb make`)
   - Implement your feature.
   - Check your code works as expected.
   - Run the code formatter: `clang-format -i $(git ls-files "*.c" "*.h")`.
   - Run the code linter: `clang-tidy -p . $(git ls-files "*.c" "*.h")`. Some checks are pretty pedantic, feel free to ignore or debate some of the rules.
   - If you prefer, you can run `make pre-commit` to run several code style checks like the above along a few extra stuff (shellcheck, spellcheck, prettier, etc).

3. Commit your changes to a new branch (not `master`, one change per branch) and push it:
   - Commit messages should:
     - Header line: explain the commit in one line (use the imperative) ("feat" for features, "fix", "style", "chore", "docs", etc)
     - Be descriptive.
     - Don't make the title too long and add commit descriptions if you think the changes need it.
     - e.g. "feat: add support for X", "fix(config): config parser segfaulting", "docs(typo): fix a typo in README.md"

4. Once you are happy with your changes, submit a pull request.
   - Open the pull request.
   - Add a short description explaining what you've done (or if it's a work-in-progress - what you need to do)

## Issues

1. Do a quick search on GitHub to check if the issue has already been reported.
2. [Open an issue](https://github.com//javalsai/lidm/issues/new) and describe the issue you are having - you could include:
   - Screenshots.
   - Ways to reproduce the issue.
   - Your lidm version.
   - Your platform (e.g. arch linux or Ubuntu 15.04 x64) and init system if you know.

After reporting you should aim to answer questions or clarifications as this helps pinpoint the cause of the issue.

## Other

If you are unsure what category your contribution falls under, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com//javalsai/lidm/issues/new) or [a discussion](https://github.com//javalsai/lidm/discussions/new) to talk about it.
